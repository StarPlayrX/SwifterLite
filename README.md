### What is Swifter Lite?

Unofficial fork of Swifter written in [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) programming language, designed to be an embedded REST API server for iOS macOS and tvOS. This fork focuses on speed and reliability with the ability to stream audio and video seamlessly on or to any Apple device. SwifterLite can also create a REST api middleware layer and use abstraction to any proprietary api that might not be supported natively, directly or is easier keeping it separated in case of changes.

Supports data, json, text, bytes, audio and video streaming over HLS, over HTTP 1.1 protocol via http://localhost, ipv4 tcp/ip

Currently used in StarPlayrX and future IPTVee works by Todd Bruss

### Branches
`1.5.1`

#### To Do REST API examples to be expanded

### How to start server with 1 route and select its port
```swift
let server = HttpServer()
server.get["/ping"] = { request in
    return HttpResponse.ok(.text("pong"))

let port = 8080
try? server.start(port, forceIPv4: true)
```

### Data Route
```swift
func dataRoute(_ data: Data) -> httpReq {{ request in
    return HttpResponse.ok(.data(data, contentType: "application/octet-stream"))
}}

let data = Data("commanderData".utf8)
server.get["/commander/data"] = dataRoute(data: data)
```

### Swift Package Manager.
```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "YourServerName",
    products: [
        .library(
            name: "YourServerName",
            targets: ["YourServerName"]),
    ],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/StarPlayrX/Swifter-Lite", branch: "1.5.1")
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "YourServerName",
            dependencies: [.product(name: "SwifterLite", package: "Swifter-Lite")]
        ),
    ]
)
```
